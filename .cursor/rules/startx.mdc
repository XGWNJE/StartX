# StartX Chrome Extension Development Guidelines

## Simplified Project Structure
- `/public`: Static assets and extension manifest
- `/src`: Source code
  - `/components`: Core React components (Search, Bookmarks, Settings)
  - `/hooks`: Custom React hooks
  - `/services`: Browser API services
  - `store.ts`: Centralized state management
  - `types.ts`: TypeScript type definitions
  - `utils.ts`: Utility functions

## Core Development Principles
1. Focus on user-facing functionality over complexity
2. Prioritize performance and stability of search/bookmark features
3. Use functional React components with proper TypeScript types
4. Keep code modular and maintainable
5. Implement appropriate error handling

## Feature Requirements
1. Search component with multiple engine support and bookmark integration
2. Theme system with light/dark modes and wallpaper customization
3. Settings persistence using Chrome Storage API
4. Responsive and accessible UI

## Development Process
1. Implement core functionality before adding enhancements
2. Test thoroughly on Chrome browser environments
3. Optimize for performance and resource usage
4. Document critical functions and components

## Quality Assurance
1. Ensure fast startup and response time
2. Handle common error scenarios gracefully
3. Protect user privacy and data
4. Maintain compatibility with Chrome's extension policies
